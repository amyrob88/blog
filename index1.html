        <p>I am currently a stay at home mum, who is looking at going back to work, and creating a career for myself. After having 9 years out of work, and only having experience in customer services, I decided I wanted a change. And that my career should be in IT, as it is a growing industry, but with a lack of certified and experienced people for those rolls that are available.
            In my spare time, I play video games, read around my chosen career choice, practice building websites, and I also have an allotment, which I go to most weekends with my children and my partner.
            My partner has helped me when it comes to coding and learning about the IT industry, as he is a back end developer, who started as a front end developer. He not only has 10 years experience in the IT industry but he also has certifications.  
        </p>
        <h1>Why I chose codenation.</h1>
        <p>I had an advert pop up on Facebook for the cyber security course, and as someone who has been looking at going into the IT sector, especially after 9 years of being unemployed, due to having children, i thought this would be a great opportunity, not only to gain qualifications, but to have the potential to get an apprenticeship, learning and gaining experience in field i very much want to be a part of. i believe what code nation are doing is amazing. I also, very much, would like to be apart of bridging the gap of women in this area.</p>

        <h1>Why technology and coding</h1>
        <p>Technology is becoming more and more available to everybody, of any age. and most day to day is affected by technology. I have always had an interest in technology, it started with my love for video games, playing on consoles like playstation, Nintendo, and portable consoles, not to mention PC gaming.
                As i am getting older, i am finding the working of software and computers far more interesting. And seeing the fished product, i appreciate the time and money that must go in to creating games and software for the masses. To be a part of that would be amazing, creating something that people use on a regular basis, knowing i helped make life better, or more fun for others would be the greatest feeling.</p>
