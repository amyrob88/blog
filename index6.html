        <p>The tools that I have used for my projects, have been visual studio code, trello, and slack. I fully enjoy using all of these tools that are available. And I have done a bit of research regarding trello. As I use a lot of Microsoft software I was happy to find that there is a plug in for Microsoft project, making project management much easier, and meaning all areas of project management are covered.
            With the many different tools and software I have used, for my projects, I have enjoyed using all of them. They are easy and straight forward to use. Very affective when planning the projects but also very useful when coding. Having used sublime in the past, I prefer using visual studio code for coding. My reasons for liking visual studio code, are the colour coordination for different things, how it recognises the syntax being used, and the autofinish when typing out tags etc.
            As for any issues I have encountered, I really haven't found any issues, but I have only been using visual studio code for a short time, and I have only done a small project, therefore I haven't used everything that is available on visual studio code.
        </p>
        <p>I fully believe that the tool I have used were perfect for the job. Slack was great for getting information and sharing ideas with the whole group. Visual studio code is easy to use and covers most languages. And tello helps set out a plan to follow, and covers what work needs to be done in the project.</p>

        <p>Overall, I like my website, due to it being my first one. But there are some things I would change, and definitely some things I would add, if I had more time and more knowledge.There are lots of things I would change.I would also fix the navbar mistake that has appeared throughout the homepage.The Trello link, I wanted to be a button, but I could not get it to work, in the process of finding a solution, I managed to break the link so it would not take me to my Trello board. In the end I fixed the link, but still could not manage to get the button function to work.
            The contact page definitely needs work, the contact box could be more detailed and larger, with better colour options to make the text more visable.
            I would also of liked to add a footer, with social media icons at the bottom of each page on the website. Possibly adding a carousel at the top of the pages would have improved the overall look of the website.
            But, as a first attempt at a website I am happy with how it flows and how easy it is to use.
        </p>
        <p>The websites works well, and how I set it up to work, the navbar buttons take the user to the pages they select. And the links for pictures and my Trello work.
            What i would like to add to the services offered page, would be a table, set out with the services I am available for, with a price range for each job. 
            Also, on my portfolio page I would link my github to each individual project, so people/ potential employers could see the work I have done, or that I am currently working on.</p>
            <p>The tools and sftware I used for planning my project, and helping keep me productive and efficient, where trello and slack.
                Slack had all the information I needed for the work, and what it needed to cover, what I then did was expand on these with Trello, planning how I was going to do it and what I was going to put in the website.
                I find that trello is a great tool when it comes to planning projects, and it helps keep me focused and on target for the work I need to do. By using labels to colour coordinate what i have done and what I still need to do is a great way to show where I am struggling, or where I am up to with a project. Personally, I think if this was done in groups, the website would have much more on it, each person could focus on a couple of section, not to mention different work spoeeds and different design ideas that would have been shared. Also, different knowledge or skills would have been shared within the group. Meaning more learning options for everybody within that group.
            </p>
            <p>To imporove my productivity and effciencey there are different things I could have done. I could have made use of my commute and made notes on trello while I was traveling back and to, to the office. I could have also set time limits on each part of the project that I listed in Trello. I did colour coordinate in Trello and I did take regular breaks when I was struggling with a particular part of code. I could have also listened to music, instead of being distracted by conversations that werte going on around me within the office.</p>

            <p>Doing a project like this, takes time for planning, researching, and creativity. The project can be done by a single person, but it will take longer to achieve the end product. I think next time, I would plan my project better, and possibly do the project in a group, with each person focusing on a different part of the project.
                so, for example, someone would focus on the research, someone would focus on the layout, someone would focus on images and photoshop. I would also have someone manage the project, and set everything up on Trello so everybody can see whats going on, and where we are up to with the project. I would also include stand up meeting and one to ones with everybody in the team, to make sure all is running smoothly. For each part of the project, on Trello, time frames would be added, so everybody is able to focus better, with the dealine. But also leaving enough time for testing, and for improvements to be added if necessary. </p>
                <p>For digital testing there are many options and many areas that need to be covered. below is a list of different things that will need to be tested for when creating digital projects or documents. Depending on the purpose of the project or document depends on how much testing will need to be done. If for instance, the project is a website, then there wiull need to be user testing, if not, and the website goes live, some users may find the website difficult to navigate.</p>
