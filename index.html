            <h2>The purpose of IT in a modern business.</h2>

            <p>All sizes of business can benefit from IT. IT in business can help every aspect of said business, not just a small part of the business. IT, if implemented correctly can, could benefit a business, by making all areas far more efficient not to mention having a better communication flow through the business.
                communication with customers. Having websites benefits a business, as it allows customers to find what it is they are looking, no matter what time of the day it is. there is no 'shop hours' as it is on the high street.
                Not to, mention the ability to reach a wider audience/ client base. due to shipping options, it also means products are available over a larger geographical area.
                efficiency of operations.
                There is software available to help business keep their financial records up to date and available to be checked as and when it is necessary. inventory can be kept up to date and checked, to keep stock levels where they should be. By utilising technology for things like this means companies can save money and time. not to mention holding meetings over the internet, allowing the meeting to take place anywhere, with as many people as need to be present for the meetings.</p>
            
            </div>
        <h2>Methods for a successful project</h2>
        <p>There are many tools and resources available to help with project management. But there are also many factors that can make a project successful or not successful. It also depends on the type of project that is being carried out, as not all projects can be managed or planned in the same way. Digital projects can be planned/ managed with many tools and resources. There are many skills needed to make a project successful, communication, leadership, organisation, risk assessment, team management, and negotiation. have the right person for the job is difficult to find, but extremely important for a project to be successful.
            Tools that I have currently been using are trello, slack and git-hub/git. Using these tools for planning projects have been very effective. By using the kanban method when using trello and planning out my projects, I have found, personally that projects have been easy to plan and manage, with clear steps and descriptions in place to allow other team members to keep updated but also allow a better communication between each member, and also keeping the flow on going with the project</p>
        
        <h2>The risks faced for digital projects</h2>

        <p>Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.

                Lack of cross-functional expertise: there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
                
                Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
                
                Fixed plans that don’t account for change. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.
                
                Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra  and spending to long suggesting colours and font sizes or font colours tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Saying "Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Selecting IT systems and software</h2>
            <p>Selecting the right IT systems and software can and will depend on the business, what the business offeres and the businesses budget. Some businesses may have an industry standard, for example, at one point illustrations industry standard was a Mac. Whereas other companies may not be able to afford that kind of system and software so will decide, due to budget, to purchase or use linux as its a cheaper option with cheaper software.</p>


            
        </div>
        <h2>Analysis of technologies I have used</h2>
        <p>Trello has been a great tool when it comes to planning projects, especially if in a team environment. having a large team have access to a trello board can be a great way to plan the project, share ideas, and discuss issues. not to mention how easy it is to prioritise different sections of the project, as well as making it known to other team members whats being done, what is done and what needs to be done. Any thing can be added to trello boards, including meetings that are needed to see how the project is coming along, as well as the time frame for the project to be completed and tested by.
                Using git/ git-hub for the version control can help with many aspects of development, and projects. As the originals are saved, so is every other version of something, meaning if anything does go wrong, then we are able to go back to an earlier version to try and find the issue within the code or the project. Helping fix problems before they become a major issue for the user or a company</p>
   
        <div>
            <h2>GDPR</h2>
            <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Is a relatively new piece of European Union legislation, regulating the processing of personal data that, will supersede and replace the old directive regulating that area.
                GDPR regulates how companies store and collect data. Design data flows in its services, and the main principle of minimizing data. If GDPR is not followed then companies face financial infringements.
                Data retention, no more data saved for marketing, sales etc. It also affects how user accounts/forms are created, and what data can be saved and for how long.
                Verify legal basis of the processing, its scope and the technical solutions. policies and terms and conditions will now need to be changed or updated.

        </ol>
        <h2>Copyright and constraints for websites.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Copyright v other IP rights
                Copyright must be properly distinguished from other kinds of intellectual property (IP) right: patents, trade marks, rights in designs, database rights, and so on. Nothing, but nothing, pains the IP expert more than many journalists' apparent belief that the different kinds of IP right are interchangeable.</li>
                
              <li> Copyright protects "works"
                Copyright law protects a diversity of "copyright works". It protects the oil painting, operatic symphony and poetic epic with the same principles and rules as the doodle, the advertising ditty, and the slap-dash legal article.
                
                Although "websites" are not a kind of copyright work, their constituent elements are likely to be protected by copyright. Website text and code may be protected as literary works; photographs and other website artworks may be protected as artistic works; website music tracks may be protected both as musical works and through sound recording copyright. A single video clip can accommodate a profusion of different rights.
                
                Simply cataloguing the different copyrights subsisting in a website can be a major undertaking.</li>
                
                <li> The de minimis principle
                Copyright isn't concerned with very little things. It does not protect so-called de minimis works, the classic examples of which are titles (such as The Da Vinci Code) and newspaper headlines (such as Small earthquake in Chile, not many killed); nor does copyright prevent "insubstantial copying" from a work which is protected by copyright.
                
                Unfortunately it is often difficult to decide whether a work is really de minimis, or an example of copying insubstantial. Hence the practice, prevalent in some of our cultural industries, of demanding express permission for the least act of copying.
                
                (This is not to say that it's always OK to borrow others' titles etc. Titles may, for example, be protected under the law of trade marks or passing off.)</li>
                
                <li>Ideas and expressions
                It is sometimes said that there is no copyright in an idea. This is not entirely accurate, and is more than a little misleading. Although there is no copyright in an idea as such - i.e. an idea which has not been fixed in the form of a copyright work - that is not to say that copyright does not protect the ideas which inhere in copyright works: it does, providing the ideas are of the right kind and are not too general. For example, copyright in a story could be infringed by a person copying the plot of that story, notwithstanding that the copyist takes care to avoid lifting a single phrase from the original story. Note that the ideas underlying a web design,
                no matter how specific, are probably of the wrong sort to attract the protection of the law of copyright.</li>
                
                <li>To credit or not to credit?
                Do you have a right to be identified as the author on copies of your work? Not necessarily.
                
                This right, the right of paternity, is one of the principal moral rights which arise in relation to copyright works. Moral rights are conceptually distinct from copyright itself. In English law (unusually) the paternity right only applies where it has been asserted by the author. So, if you licence others to use your artwork, but don't assert the right of paternity, they may use it without crediting you!
                
                Some of the statutory defences to a claim of copyright infringement, including the defences of "fair dealing for the purposes of research and private study" and "fair dealing for the purposes of criticism and review", usually only apply where an author has been credited in an appropriate way.</li>
                
                <li> Copyright registration services
                Try Googling "copyright registration". You'll find a plethora of different UK companies offering to help protect your works. All you have to do is submit your magnum opus and pay their fees; all they have to do is not lose your submission. Nice work.
                
                The alleged purpose of these services is to provide evidence in the event of a court case. However, the only conceivable evidence such a company could offer is that a work was created before the time of submission. Time of creation is only occasionally an issue in copyright infringement lawsuits. We aren't aware of a single copyright case which has even involved the evidence of such a company, let alone turned upon such evidence. So, don't waste your money.
                
                Note that the position regarding US copyright law is different. Registration with the US Copyright Office, although not necessary, has a number of advantages. See www.copyright.gov for details.</li>
                
                <li> The importance of ©
                The Copyright symbol matters little nowadays: in most jurisdictions copyright subsists in qualifying works, irrespective of what symbols they wear. The use of the symbol can be a pre-condition to copyright protection under the Universal Copyright Convention in countries which are not signed up to the Berne Convention - but all the major jurisdictions are now signed up to the Berne Convention.
                
                The use of the symbol does however have the effect of reminding people about copyright protection. If accompanied by the name of the copyright owner, it lets users know who owns the copyright - and from whom a licence should be taken. It also looks rather neat and professional.</li>
                
                <li> When must a licence be written?
                In English law, permissions to use copyright works (also known as licences) do NOT need to be in writing. For instance, when you make a website available to the world, you grant an implied licence to internet users to copy that website for the purpose of viewing it on a web browser. However, the exact scope of implied and unwritten licences may be unclear.
                
                There is one exception to the above rule: statutory "exclusive" licences must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the copyright owner, as must assignments (transfers) of copyright ownership.</li>
                
                <li> Acts of infringement
                Copyright infringement isn't just about copying. There are lots of different ways to infringe someone's copyright, and many of them don't directly involve copying. For instance, selling over your website CDs that someone else ripped may be copyright infringement. Again, making an adaptation of a copyright work, for instance recreating a motion picture as a cartoon strip, can infringe copyright, even if there is no literal copying.</li>
                
                <li> Copyright crimes
                Contrary to the impression given by certain content industry propaganda, copyright infringement isn't usually a criminal offence. Broadly speaking, in the UK, copyright infringement is only a crime if it is done deliberately in the course of a business or on a significant scale. So, downloading an infringing track for personal use may be copyright infringement, but it isn't usually a crime.</li>

                <li>AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved
                        Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it.
                        Use » Windows Media Player or pick up WinAmp or QuickTime.</li>
                        
                        <li>CSS — Cascading StyleSheet
                        CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. To read more about them, see our CSS tutorials.
                        CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor, like Notepad. Try » TopStyle Lite too, it includes loads of selectors for easy editing.</li>
                        
                       <li> .DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument
                        Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them.
                        Buy the hideously expensive » Microsoft Word, or just hope that it came with your computer. You can get a “Word viewer” from Microsoft too, which is free. If both of these go against your religion, you could use the free » Open Office suite, which is pretty damn good.</li>
                        
                        <li>.EXE — EXEcutable file
                        If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.
                        Just double click it to install on your PC. Be careful of viruses!</li>

                        <li>.RAM — Real Audio Movie
                        Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats, before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that everyone with sense decided to stop using their programs.
                        You might still come across real audio files around the net, so hand over all your personal details to get whatever player » Real are trying to sell you this week.</li>
                        
                        <li>.RAR — RAR archive
                        This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files.

                       <li> .TIFF — Tagged Image File Format
                        For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser.
                        Your only choice is to get a — Hooray! — image editor.</li>
                        
                       <li> .TXT — TeXT file
                        The most basic of files, it’s just some text.
                        You no doubt already have either NotePad, SimpleText, or your browser.</li>
                        
                        <li>.WAV — WAVe sound file
                        A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.

                       <li> .ZIP — ZIPped file
                        Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with.

                       <li> Streaming Media
                        Over the past few years many new file formats were brought in for the reason of allowing streaming — that is, the file starts playing as soon as it begins to be downloaded, and keeps on playing as more of the file makes its way to your computer. The hugely successful mp3 quickly became the most popular of these formats. The proprietary RealAudio and RealVideo formats from » Real are popular among multimedia sites, but are terrible formats that require a truly horrible piece of software to play. Mpeg, AVI and MP4 video are also very popular, and can be played in many programs like Quicktime Player, VLC and Windows Media Player. These type of files are most important when embedding multimedia.</li>
